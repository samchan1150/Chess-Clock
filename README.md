# Chess Clock App

The Chess Clock app is a web-based application that simulates a traditional chess clock, allowing two players to time their moves during a game. It's ideal for chess enthusiasts who want a simple and customizable timing solution.

## How to Use the App

### Launching the App
- Open the application in your web browser.
- You'll see two clocks labeled Player 1 and Player 2, each displaying the default starting time of 5 minutes.

### Setting Up the Clocks
- Click on the **Settings** button to open the clock settings modal.
- In the settings modal, you can customize:
  - **Player 1 Starting Time** (in minutes)
  - **Player 1 Increment** (additional seconds added after each move)
  - **Player 2 Starting Time** (in minutes)
  - **Player 2 Increment** (additional seconds added after each move)
- Adjust the values to your preference. For example, set a starting time of 10 minutes with a 5-second increment.

### Saving Your Settings
- After configuring the settings, click the **Save Settings** button.
- The clocks will update to reflect the new starting times and increments.

### Starting the Game
- To begin, the player who goes second should click on their opponent's clock. For instance, if Player 1 makes the first move, Player 2 clicks on Player 1's clock to start Player 1's timer.
- The active player's clock will start counting down, indicated by a visual highlight.

### Switching Turns
- After making a move, a player taps their own clock to end their turn. Doing so will:
  - Stop their timer.
  - Add their designated increment to their remaining time.
  - Activate the other player's clock, starting their countdown.

### Gameplay Flow
- Players continue to alternate turns, tapping their own clocks to switch the active player.
- The increments (if any) are automatically applied after each player's turn.

### Ending the Game
- The game ends when one player's time runs out.
- An alert will notify whose time has expired, indicating that the player has lost on time.

### Adjustments During Play
- You can pause the game by opening the settings modal.
- To reset the clocks, adjust the settings or refresh the page.

## Additional Features

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Visual cues highlight the active player, and large buttons make it easy to interact during intense gameplay.

## Tips for Optimal Use

- Ensure both players understand when to tap the clocks to prevent timing errors.
- Customize increments for different chess formats, like Blitz or Rapid games.
- Use the app for other two-player turn-based games that require timing.

Enjoy your games with the Chess Clock app, and may the best strategist win!
